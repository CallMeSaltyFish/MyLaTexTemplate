abstract = "Positioning an individual with high accuracy is important since many location-based services rely on the position of the user to provide them with ubiquitous services. Despite the need for accuracy, no perfect solution has been proposed for the problem of accurately positioning an individual. A number of attempts to improve the accuracy has been made achieving an accuracy of about 2 meters using sophisticated techniques and the advances made in the mobile industry. In this paper we explain the methodology to get a propagation model suitable for Bluetooth in order to get a more accurate distance measurement, and also the algorithm to combine it with WiFi to position a user in an indoor environment. Firstly, we get measurements of distance related to a RSSI value obtained from the Bluetooth to get a propagation model, we compute a distance using the known propagation model from WiFi, and finally an algorithm to obtain the location of the receiver combinig Bluetooth and WiFi is presented."
